This code was written by Rephael Haddad and Ido Masar for the "Needle in a Haystack" Course.

Instructions:
Place "music_festivals.csv" and "fruits.csv" at the same location as needle_ex1.
Then, you can see our line of thought by inspecting the order of the code blocks and use our written unit-tests below each code block.
